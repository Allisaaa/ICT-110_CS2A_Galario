Tau is a circle constant and the value is equivalent to 2Ï€.\n","\n","**math.nan**: The math.nan constant returns a floating-point nan (Not a Number) value. This value is not a legal number.\n","\n","**math.inf**: The math.inf constant returns a floating-point positive infinity.For negative infinity, use -math.inf.
